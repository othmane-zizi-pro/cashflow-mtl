          <p>
            CashFlow MTL was created to democratize real estate investment analysis in Montreal.
            We believe that powerful investment analytics shouldn't be limited to institutional
            investors with expensive tools. Our mission is to provide individual investors with
            the same level of data-driven insights using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

            <h3>How accurate are the revenue forecasts?</h3>
            <p>
              Our AI model is trained on 8,518+ real Airbnb listings in Montreal and provides
              data-driven estimates. However, actual results will vary based on many factors including
              property management, seasonality, market conditions, and local regulations.

            <p>
              Property listings come from Centris.ca, Quebec's official real estate listing service.
              Airbnb market data comes from Inside Airbnb, a publicly available dataset of rental listings.

            <h3>Is short-term rental legal in Montreal?</h3>
            <p>
              Montreal has specific regulations for short-term rentals. You must comply with local
              laws, obtain proper permits, and register with the appropriate authorities. We recommend
              consulting with a local real estate lawyer.
